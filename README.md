### What Works Well

---

✅ Intel HD 520 (With QE/CI)

✅ All USB Port

✅ VGA Port

✅ Keyboard

✅ Touchpad

✅ Onboard Ethernet

✅ Webcam

✅ Battery Status

✅ FN Keys (Almost all key working)

✅ Native Power Management

✅ Optical Drive

✅ Restart, Sleep, Shutdown

✅ Wifi and Bluetooth

### What Works (with Notes)

---

⚠️ Audio (Internal mic work but not auto switchable)

~~⚠️ Bluetooth (Boot to Windows/Linux/VM to load firmware) [AR9565]~~

⚠️ ~~Wi-Fi (Cosmetically I notice the WiFi signal tree will randomly drop down to one or no bars and randomly full strength. Allthough this happens I saw no performance drops when this happens.) [AR9565]~~

### Does Not Work

---

❌ NVIDIA 940MX (Optimus - impossible to get working at the moment)

❌ iMessage (TODO fix)

❌ FaceTime (TODO fix)

### Not Tested

---

1. SD Card Reader

2. HDMI

### SSDT Patch

---

- **OC/ACPI**
  
  **SSDT-ATK-BDW** - To remapping Fn Key (AsusSMC only fix Fn volume)
  
  **SSDT-dGPU-Off** - To disable dGPU
  
  **SSDT-EC-USBX** - Fixing Embedded Controller
  
  **SSDT-I2C** - Patch VoodooI2C also GPIO Pinning
  
  **SSDT-I2CBUS** - Potential fix trackpad randomly stopped
  
  **SSDT-PLUG** - Fixing Power Management
  
  **SSDT-PNLF** - Fixing brightness
  
  **SSDT-SBUS-MCHC** - Fixing SMBus support
  
  ~~**SSDT-UIAC** - To remapping USB Port (Generated by [USBMap](https://github.com/corpnewt/USBMap))~~
  
  **SSDT-XOSI** - Change _OSI to XOSI

---

**<mark>Note : </mark>**

- The compiled SSDT patch has not used checking `If (_OSI ("Darwin")) {}`, so it might affect other operating systems when using dual boot / more. (but I only use single boot only)

- Just activate one of the VoodooInput from VoodooI2C or VoodooPS2Controller in config.plist (so that it doesn't conflict)

- In macOS Big Sur. Internal mic works, but mic for combo jack doesn't work (in previous macOS version it works). for workaround you can follow the following tutorial [ComboJack support for ALC256/ALC255](https://github.com/hackintosh-stuff/ComboJack)

- ~~You need to disable ATH9Injector.kext and IO80211Family.kext on config.plist to prevent kernel panic when updating MacOS then enable again after update. [AR9565]~~

- Starting from opencore version `0.7.2` there is additional option to set `minDate` (minimum allowed APFS driver date) and `minVersion` (minimum allowed APFS driver version). By default it will be set to 0 for security purposes. but it should be noted if you use an operating system below the bigsur version and use the default value. you can see it in more detail in the opencore configuration documentation.
